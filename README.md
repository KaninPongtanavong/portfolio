  This project was part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, aimed at demonstrating the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course. We performed the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act to analyze over 4,000,000 bike share records. The goal was to uncover user behaviors and preferences to develop actionable recommendations. We used Python to prepare, process, and analyze the data. Additionally, we used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard to visualize findings and insights.

  This project was part of the Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization certificate, focusing on using data visualization techniques to explore Airbnb listings in New York City. As part of this project, a Tableau storyboard was created to uncover pricing trends and guest preferences, providing actionable insights using Airbnb listing data from the last 12 months leading up to September 5, 2023, with over 30,000 listings. The analysis aimed to gain insights into factors influencing property prices and listing success, covering details about hosts, property types, prices, and guest reviews. The findings were presented clearly and engagingly to demonstrate data storytelling skills.

  Developed predictive models to forecast the closing prices of 10 stocks across various industries (telecommunications, banking, mass transportation, insurance, and energy) using random forest and long short-term memory (LSTM) techniques. The dataset included daily open, close, high, and low prices from June 1, 2019, to June 27, 2022. The objective of this study was to predict stock closing prices and compare the performance of both models, along with examining the next day's stock closing price predictions by the best-performing model. This project was part of my B.S. in Applied Mathematics program.
