This project focuses on using data visualization techniques to explore Airbnb listings in New York City. Created a Tableau storyboard to uncover pricing trends and guest preferences, providing actionable insights using Airbnb listing data from the last 12 months leading up to September 5, 2023, with over 30,000 listings. The analysis aimed to gain insights into factors influencing property prices and listing success, covering details about hosts, property types, prices, and guest reviews. The findings were presented clearly and engagingly to demonstrate data storytelling skills.

  Developed predictive models to forecast the closing prices of 10 stocks across various industries (telecommunications, banking, mass transportation, insurance, and   energy) using random forest and long short-term memory (LSTM) techniques. The dataset included daily open, close, high, and low prices from June 1, 2019, to June     27, 2022. This project was part of my B.S. in Applied Mathematics program and aimed to compare the performance of both models in predicting stock prices.
