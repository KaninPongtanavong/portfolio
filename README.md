* **Applied Mathematics Project:** Stock Closing Price Prediction using random forest model and LSTM model

  Developed predictive models to forecast the closing prices of 10 stocks across various industries (telecommunications, banking, mass transportation, insurance, and   energy) using random forest and long short-term memory (LSTM) techniques. The dataset included daily open, close, high, and low prices from June 1, 2019, to June     27, 2022. This project was part of my B.S. in Applied Mathematics program and aimed to compare the performance of both models in predicting stock prices.
